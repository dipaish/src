//One requirement in project: JavaScript event handlers for HTML element.  
/* 
- Watch the video recording and use some event such as onclick, onchange, 
 onmouseover etc  on your project pages. 
- I will check this with all teams at 14:00 
- At 14:00, we will get back to Zoom and in the main session 
each team will show the javascript implementation briefly
- 12:45 - 13:50, you can find me in teams if you need help.
- Put most of your javascript code in an external file and use it within your pages from the 
external file.
